# Oolala-Cabs: A Case-Study
Oolala, a cab aggregator service, has a problem statement which they want you to validate and provide an explanation backed by numbers. 
It is observed and reported that customers are not able to find cabs to go to the Airport as drivers are canceling airport trips. 
They want you to investigate if this is indeed true. If yes, Why?
